                    When Kelly was younger he actually dreamed of becoming a

                    etc. He went to Pennsylvania State College and the

                    economics respectively.
                    <!--This section would be like the in-between section, between his life and his carrear-->

                    to New York City in 1938, he was a chorus member in Cole

                    musical / drama "Pal Joey", his performance in "Pal Joey"
                    got Kelly an offer for a Hollywood contract and he left New
                    York in 1941. Gene Kelly’s film debut was in a movie with
                    Judy Garland called "For Me and My Gal" (1942).
                    <!--Talk about Kelly's later life here-->

                    classical ballet technique, transformed the movie musical
                    and did much to change the American public’s conception of
                    male dancers.
